                <li>1 1/4 lbs thinly sliced steak such as flank steak or sirloin</li>
                <li>3 cups of mixed vegetables (I used broccoli florets and sliced bell peppers)</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

                <li>Optional garnishes: sliced green onions and sesame seeds</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>For the sauce:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced ginger</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of honey</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon toasted soil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sauce: Place the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, honey and sesame oil in a small pot over medium high heat. Stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Turn up heat to high and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water until dissolved. Add the cornstarch mixture to the sauce and boil for 1-2 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Set sauce aside.</li>
            <li>For the stir fry: Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the vegetables and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until vegetables have started to brown and soften.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of water and cook, until water has evaporated. When your vegetables are crisp tender remove them from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Wipe out the pan. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil in the pan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Place half of the steak in the pan and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until just cooked through.</li>
            <li>Set the first batch of steak aside and repeat the process with the rest of the beef.</li>
            <li>Add all of the meat and vegetables back to the pan. Pour the sauce over the top and cook for 2-3 minutes over medium high heat until warmed through.</li>
            <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions if desired.</li>
        </ol>
